# Premium Auction Backend

Welcome to the backend for a **premium auction platform**, built with a focus on **scalability**, **security**, and **performance**. This project is designed to support real-time bidding, user role management, and secure transactions in an online auction environment.

## 🛠️ Recent Updates
### Why the Changes?
Due to security vulnerabilities detected in some of the previously used libraries, such as **Keycloak** and **Lettuce (Redis)**, this project has opted to:
- Replace **Keycloak** with **ZITADEL**, a modern and open-source identity and access management (IAM) platform.
- Replace **Lettuce** with **Redisson**, a more robust and secure library for interacting with Redis.

These updates ensure a **more secure and stable foundation** for handling authentication, authorization, and caching in this application.

---

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **Java + Spring Boot**: Framework for building scalable backend services.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for transactional data.
- **ZITADEL**: Modern identity and access management for OAuth2 and OpenID Connect.
- **Redis + Redisson**: In-memory database for caching and real-time notifications.
- **Spring Security**: Fine-grained access control with JWT authentication.
- **Docker**: Containerized deployment for all services.
